# Here4u


Here4U is an innovative project at the intersection of technology and mental healthcare. It's designed as an AI-powered platform to provide accessible, affordable, and personalized mental health support. The project is inspired by the growing need for alternative mental health services that are more inclusive and adaptable to individual needs.

The core of Here4U is Julian, a conceptual AI chatbot developed to offer empathetic interactions and support. Julian is designed to use advanced NLP and ML algorithms for understanding human emotions and providing tailored responses. The platform aims to include features like mood tracking, group sessions, and a community feed, fostering a supportive environment for users.

As of now, Here4U's development has focused on the UI/UX aspect, laying the groundwork for future AI integration. The AI functionalities, including the chatbot Julian, are in the conceptual stage and are part of ongoing research and development.

This project represents a step towards democratizing mental health support, addressing barriers like cost, accessibility, and stigma. It's a testament to the potential of AI in transforming healthcare services, aiming to fill a critical gap in current mental health care provisions.

Note: The AI component is currently under development and the project is part of my academic dissertation.
